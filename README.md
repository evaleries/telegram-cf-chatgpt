# Telegram BOT CF GPT

A Telegram bot that utilizes the power of ChatGPT to provide users with intelligent and engaging responses. 

I'm using telegram bot template from [cvzi/telegram-bot-cloudflare](https://github.com/cvzi/telegram-bot-cloudflare) and simply call API to chatgpt as a response.
With this bot, users can engage in natural language conversations and receive personalized responses that are tailored to their specific needs.
